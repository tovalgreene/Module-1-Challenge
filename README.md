# Module-1-Challenge

## The task was to change the non-semantic HTML to semantic HTML for clarity and specification, and to consolidate and organize its linked CSS file. 

This site is an example marketing site of an imaginary client, Horiseon. While the layout is the same, the back-end HTML is organized re: traditional semantic HTML syntax, and its CSS is organized in conjunction with the HTML. Semantic HTML is beneficial to coders as anyone who sees the code will know what each line is doing, while non-semantic HTML is more up for interpretation. 
Since there is no JavaScript, the site is not interactive. This assignment was to understand the importance of clarity, conciseness, and organization when dealing with HTML and CSS.
